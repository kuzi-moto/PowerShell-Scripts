# PowerShell

Just a repository of random PowerShell scripts and bits I create. Some scripts rely on external files, and so pulling the whole repository will ensure everything works.

## Scripts

* [Excel-to-PDF](Excel-to-PDF/) - Merges multiple Excel files into a single PDF.
* [SlackExport-to-HTML](SlackExport-to-HTML) - Creates a HTML file for each channel in a Slack export folder.
